/**
 * In Kotlin, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be
 * subclassed by other classes. Abstract classes are used to define common behavior and
 * characteristics that should be shared among multiple subclasses,
 * but they may leave certain details to be implemented
 * by the concrete subclasses.
