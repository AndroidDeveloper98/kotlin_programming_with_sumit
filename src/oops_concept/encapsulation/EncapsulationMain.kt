/**
 *
 * Encapsulation is the technique of hiding the internal state and requiring all interactions to be performed
 * through an objectâ€™s methods. This is typically achieved by making fields private and providing public
 * getter and setter methods. Encapsulation helps in safeguarding the data and improving the modularity
 * and maintainability of the code.
 *
 * This class represents a Book with encapsulated properties.
 * Encapsulation is achieved by making fields private and
 * providing public methods to interact with them.
