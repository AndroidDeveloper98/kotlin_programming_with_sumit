/**
 * In Kotlin, inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
 * Kotlin supports various types of inheritance,each serving different purposes.
 * Hereâ€™s an overview of the types of inheritance in Kotlin:
 *
 * Type of inheritance
 *
 * Single
 * Multiple
 * MultiLevel
 * Hybrid (Combination of two and more inheritance).
 * Hierarchical
 */


/**
 * Single inheritance is the most common form of inheritance, where a class inherits from one base class.
 */

// Parent class declaration with an open method that can be overridden by child classes
open class SuperClass {
    // Open method that prints a greeting message, allowing subclasses to override it
    open fun greeting() {
        println("Hello, Good Morning")
    }
}

// Child class that inherits from SuperClass (single inheritance)
class BaseClass : SuperClass() {
    // Overriding the greeting method from the SuperClass
    override fun greeting() {
        // Prints a different greeting message specific to the BaseClass
        println("Hello, World")
    }
}

/**
 * Kotlin does not support multiple inheritance of classes directly
 * but supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
 * A class can implement multiple interfaces.
 */

// Interface 1: Defines a contract for flying behavior
interface Flyer {
    // Abstract function that must be implemented by any class that implements this interface
    fun fly()
}

// Interface 2: Defines a contract for swimming behavior
interface Swimmer {
    // Abstract function that must be implemented by any class that implements this interface
    fun swim()
}

// Class implementing multiple interfaces
class Duck : Flyer, Swimmer {
    // Implementation of the 'fly' method from the 'Flyer' interface
    override fun fly() {
        println("Duck flies") // Prints that the duck is flying
    }

    // Implementation of the 'swim' method from the 'Swimmer' interface
    override fun swim() {
        println("Duck swims") // Prints that the duck is swimming
    }
}

/**
 * Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented programming where
 * a class is derived from another class, which in turn is derived from a third class.
 * In this hierarchical chain, each class inherits the properties and behaviors of its predecessor,
 * allowing for the reuse and extension of code across multiple levels of classes.
